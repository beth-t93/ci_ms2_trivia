## Project Goals
The aim of this project is to create a simple and easy to navigate quiz game. The information for the questions will be pulled from a trivia API so as to allow a bigger range of questions, as well as the ability for new questions to be added without the need to program new questions directly into the site.

This constant flow of new questions will reduce the risk of users getting bored of too many repeat questions.


## User Experience
### User Goals
- An easy to use site
- Start the game quickly and easily
- Be constantly engaged during the game with feedback on answers
- The questions will be updated regularly to avoid repeat questions
- The site will be eyecatching, but also uses a design and colour scheme that is not difficult to read and use.


### Target Audience
- Quiz enthusiast
- Someone looking to pass the time without having to invest time in signing up to a site
- A casual user

### User Stories
#### Visitor Goals
1. As a first time visitor I want the site to be easy and simple to use
2. As a first time visitor I want the site to be colourful and eyecatching, as well as be easy to read
3. As a first time visitor I would like the option to choose the question category
4. As a first time visitor I would like the option to chosse the question difficulty
5. As a first time visitor I want to be able to return to the site and not get the same questions every time.

#### Site Owner Goals
9. As a site owner I want the site to be easy to use
10. Keep the maintenance of the site as minimal as possible by using an API to source the quiz questions

### User Requirements and Expectations
#### Requirements
- Easy to navigate
- Appealing design
- Relevant information to guide the user through the game
- Clean design that further helps the user navigate throught a game with no distractions.

#### Expectations
- Navigation links and buttons take you to the page they say they will
- Social media links will open in a separate tab
- When using the contact button all fields will be required before being able to send the message
- To receive feedback on answers, whether they are correct or not


## Scope
Based on the above information, features to be included in the design include:
- An easy to navigate homepage with an obvious path to the game itself
- An error (404) page to direct site users back to the homepage should there be a broken URL.
- Favicon to help users identify the site in any tabs.

## Structure
A responsive trivia quiz site consisiting of ... pages

The site will be easy to use across all devices, enabling the user to start a quiz quickly from pretty much anywhere.

## Design Choices
The style of the site will be simple and minimal so it remains easy to navigate, but also so it keeps the users attention to finish the quiz, and even complete multiple rounds of questions.

### Colours
The colour scheme for this site is meant to be bright and eye catching to the user, however there should still be enough contrast between the colours used so that the site remains easy to read and navigate for longer periods of time.

![images](docs/features/ms2-colour-scheme.jpg)

I have chosen a colour scheme that is bright and eyecatching to the user.
 -Colour 1: (Hex: #0B3954) This is a dark blue that is used for the background thoughout the whole site, it gives the other content a darker background so it is able to stand out from the page. This colour is also used for the text colour on the buttons of the site.
 -Colour 2: (Hex: #BFD7EA) I chose this colour to contrast well with the background colour, it will be used throughout the site for key information, such as the quiz questions and social media icons.
 -Colour 3: (Hex: #FF5A5F) This colour is used as a fun pop of colour against the dark background. It will be used for the logo and test content on the home page, as well as give emphasis to other items on the site, such as the answer selection boxes.
### Fonts/Typography
To ensure the website is easily readable while also keeping to the simple and minimal design, the fonts used are: Bebas Neue for headings and the logo and Montserrat for all other text (these are taken from Google Fonts library) with sans-serif being the fallback font should either of the selected fonts be unavailable.

5. [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used to create the mockup you see at the start of this README.md file
6. [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.2525881,-3.1265367,14z) was used to embed a map with location pin into the site
